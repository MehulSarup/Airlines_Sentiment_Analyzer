# Introduction
British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom (UK). Every day, thousands of BA flights arrive to and depart from the UK, carrying customers across the world. Whether itâ€™s for holidays, work, or any other reason, the end-to-end process of scheduling, planning, boarding, fuelling, transporting, landing, and continuously running flights on time, efficiently and with top-class customer service is a huge task with many highly important responsibilities.

Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA. So I have scraped the reviews data from the web and then did a Sentiment Analysis on the reviews of British Airways to find what gives the passengers a good or bad experience.

# Aim
To scrape the reviews from the website and then analyze the sentiments of the passengers' reviews on British Airways.

# Techniques
I have used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data from the web. Then used the NLP library NLTK to perform text pre-processing to remove special characters, numbers, and stopwords, and then lemmatize the text to get the root word according to the context. Then I used NLTK's VADER lexicon model to perform sentiment analysis, which provided me with sentiments that the reviews fall in - "Positive, "Negative", "Neutral". For positive and negative reviews, I created word clouds to visualize the words that had more emphasis in the reviews.

# Conclusion
After classifying the sentiment of the data using the NLTK VADER model, the text was visualized for insights through word clouds. From that, it was deduced that 50.4% were positive reviews in which customers had mentioned "easy, polite, and helpful" for the staff and crew of British Airways. They have described the airlines using words like "Great" and "Incredible". In 39.4% of Negative reviews, customers have complained about the economy, premium, and business classes, and the airline's website. They have mentioned words like bad, old, and unlucky, which shows that a few services could be improved to ensure customer satisfaction.

To be able to identify if a review is positive or negative, a Logistic Regression model was developed, having an AUC-ROC score of 0.92. Further improvements to the model, like tuning the hyperparameters and having more data, would boost the accuracy of the model.
